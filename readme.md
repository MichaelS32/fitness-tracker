## CONCEPT

- User Story<br />
As a user I want to be able to become healthier (ex: lose weight, gain muscle, change diet, etc.) and have the capability to interact with others. 

- Motivation<br />
We wanted to have an app that would be fun and interactive for users. We all know that working out is not everyoneâ€™s favorite activity so we wanted to make it more interactive than just a simple record your workout app. With SoFIT we wanted to let the user see other users and their journey with a social network style feed.
